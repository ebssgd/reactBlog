The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.\nObi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.",

I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.\nThe Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.",
